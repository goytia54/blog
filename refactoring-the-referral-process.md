# Refactoring The Referral Process (11/15/2024)
I have had an influx of connections on LinkedIn since working at The Walt Disney Company. The most common type of connection has been that of asking for a referral for a job posting. However, I don't think most individuals actually understand or have forgotten what a referral is. This post is to explore my opinions on this process and how you can better refine establishing a relationship and providing data points that *could* lead to a referral. Let's do a little [refactoring.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring) 

## My Job Application and Referral Process
I believe it important to establish my own bias when writing out my opinion on topics. In terms of the job application and referral process, I have only asked for one professional referral for a job opening. This was from a great friend and gradutate school colleague. We had been in the trenches together during grad school (back in the days of my central science grind) and he also was familiar with my programming work. All my other internships and jobs came through the job application process. My last two roles came from data points provided by LinkedIn in which I was recruited to apply to a job posting.

## What Is A Referral If Not A Personal Recommendation?
I found the following descriptions of a job referral using Google:

> ... a recommendation from someone who is connected to a company for a job seeker to get extra attention from the employer

> ... a way for companies to find qualified candidates by leveraging the networks of their current employees.

I feel like these descriptions are a good start however missing one important concept, introduced in [What Is a Job Referral? How Do You Get One?](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-job-referral-how-do-you-get-one-get-hired-by-linkedin-news/): job referrals are personal. Because they are personal, I would hope when others ask for them, they understand this concept introduced by the article, "If they refer someone and they aren’t qualified for the job or don’t have the required skills, that could reflect poorly on them". 

Furthermore, because they are personal, they also don't carry much weight if you haven't established a relationship with an individual before asking for a referral. Like anything, establishing this relationship takes time, effort, and sincerity. I find it interesting that the same articles acknowledge the referral process as being personal one proceed to give a template on how to reach out to people for a referral. I don't see templates as personal, sincere, or requiring much effort; thus the opposite of what a referral should actually look like. However the job referral is not dead, just needs some refactoring.
