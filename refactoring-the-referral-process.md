# Refactoring The Referral Process (11/15/2024)
I have had an influx of connections on LinkedIn since starting at The Walt Disney Company. The most common type of connection request has been for a job referral. However, I believe many individuals either don't understand or have forgotten what a referral entails. This post explores my opinions on this process and how you can better establish relationships and provide data points that could lead to a referral. Let's do a little [refactoring.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring) 

## My Job Application and Referral Process
I believe it is important to establish my own bias when writing my opinion on topics. Regarding the job application and referral process, I have only asked for one professional referral for a job opening. This was from a great friend and graduate school colleague. We had been in the trenches together during grad school (back in the days of my central science grind), and he was also familiar with my programming work. All my other internships and jobs came through the job application process. My last two roles resulted from data points provided by LinkedIn, where I was recruited to apply for a job posting. I am also a citizen of the United States and recognize the job application process is harder for those who come here from another country.

## What Is A Referral If Not A Personal Recommendation?
I found the following descriptions of a job referral using Google:

> ... a recommendation from someone who is connected to a company for a job seeker to get extra attention from the employer

> ... a way for companies to find qualified candidates by leveraging the networks of their current employees.

It's crucial to understand that job referrals are personal. As highlighted in the article [What Is a Job Referral? How Do You Get One?](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-job-referral-how-do-you-get-one-get-hired-by-linkedin-news/), if someone refers a candidate who isn't qualified or lacks the required skills, it could reflect poorly on the referrer. Because referrals are personal, they don't carry much weight if you haven't established a relationship with the individual before asking for one. Building this relationship takes time, effort, and sincerity.

I find it interesting that while many articles acknowledge the personal nature of referrals, they often provide templates for reaching out to people for a referral. I don't see templates as personal, sincere, or requiring much effort; thus, they are the opposite of what a referral should actually look like. However, the job referral is not dead; it just needs some refactoring.

## A Data Driven Approach
As I have mentioned above, I have only had one referral for a job. Most of my job opportunities have come from demostrating my skills in measureable processes. LinkedIn used to allow people to take skill assessments for various techinical skills such as programming languages and frameworks. Recruiters then had access to these data points and would then invite me to interview for roles. Unfortantely LinkedIn no longer supports skill assessments however I believe there are still tools out there for proving your competency in high demand skills. 

For instance, consider [Pluarsight's Skill IQ](https://www.pluralsight.com/product/skills-assessment). This platform has many skill assessments which you can take periodically (every 2 weeks ?) to demostrate your progression. They also have a skill
