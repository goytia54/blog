# Refactoring The Referral Process (11/15/2024)
I have had an influx of connections on LinkedIn since starting at The Walt Disney Company. The most common type of connection request has been for a job referral. However, I believe many individuals either don't understand or have forgotten what a referral entails. This post explores my opinions on this process and how you can better establish relationships and provide data points that could lead to a referral. Let's do a little [refactoring.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring) 

## My Job Application and Referral Process
I believe it is important to establish my own bias when writing my opinion on topics. Regarding the job application and referral process, I have only asked for one professional referral for a job opening. This was from a great friend and graduate school colleague. We had been in the trenches together during grad school (back in the days of my central science grind), and he was also familiar with my programming work. All my other internships and jobs came through the job application process. My last two roles resulted from data points provided by LinkedIn, where I was recruited to apply for a job posting. I am also a citizen of the United States and recognize the job application process is harder for those who come here from another country.

## What Is A Referral If Not A Personal Recommendation?
I found the following descriptions of a job referral using Google:

> ... a recommendation from someone who is connected to a company for a job seeker to get extra attention from the employer

> ... a way for companies to find qualified candidates by leveraging the networks of their current employees.

It's crucial to understand that job referrals are personal. As highlighted in the article [What Is a Job Referral? How Do You Get One?](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-job-referral-how-do-you-get-one-get-hired-by-linkedin-news/), if someone refers a candidate who isn't qualified or lacks the required skills, it could reflect poorly on the referrer. Because referrals are personal, they don't carry much weight if you haven't established a relationship with the individual before asking for one. Building this relationship takes time, effort, and sincerity.

I find it interesting that while many articles acknowledge the personal nature of referrals, they often provide templates for reaching out to people for a referral. I don't see templates as personal, sincere, or requiring much effort; thus, they are the opposite of what a referral should actually look like. However, the job referral is not dead; it just needs some refactoring.

## A Data Driven Approach
As I have mentioned above, I have only had one referral for a job. Most of my job opportunities have come from demonstrating my skills in measurable processes. LinkedIn used to allow people to take skill assessments for various technical skills such as programming languages and frameworks. Recruiters then had access to these data points and would invite me to interview for roles. Unfortunately, LinkedIn no longer supports skill assessments; however, I believe there are still tools out there for proving your competency in high-demand skills. (Feel free to tag LinkedIn on said platform to allow me to consult them on what they are missing out on ðŸ˜†)

For instance, consider [Pluarsight's Skill IQ](https://www.pluralsight.com/product/skills-assessment). This platform has many skill assessments which you can take periodically to demonstrate your progression. The assessments also give you a skill level, which is beneficial in documenting your level on a resume. I have suggested making a collage of these skill assessment graphics to include on a cover letter. Pluralsight is not the only site you can use to measure your skills but is an example of how we can use data to support our job-seeking process. You can use this information as well to reach out to those you network with and show them the effort you have put in/how this would set you up to be successful for a role that they could refer you to.

### Skill Assessment Notes
Using search engines and AI to take skill assessments will give you a false sense of security about what you know and understand. Using these tools will make your assessments look great and might get you job interviews; however, you will be pressed on your knowledge in interviews and thus will be exposed if you truly don't know what you say you do. It is okay not to know everything; however, you can still know a great deal on certain topics without using a search engine or AI to prove that point.

## Conclusion
I don't believe the referral is dead; however, I think we need to be honest with ourselves in asking for one. Are we actually taking the time to personally network with someone and establish a relationship/rapport? Are we providing data points to help in this effort? Are we understanding that this might take time and trust to nurture and grow said relationship? Much like anything in real life, processes take time and effort, and there really is no easy *hack* or *shortcut* to progression. However, as we put in the time and effort with iteration, the processes can be improved, even *refactored*.
